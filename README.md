## Features

A universal cross-platform CLI number conversion program, written in Go, that:

- Converts any number of arbitrary size, to and from any arbitrary base.

- The number can be arbitrarily large.

- Supports negative and floating-point numbers in most bases. (Except a few for which that makes no sense.) Even bases designed only for binary-to-text encoding (RFC 4648 §4), can usually be used "off-label" for positional notation - and thus negative and fractional numbers.

	- The program supports defining alternate symbols for "negative" and "decimal", if the regular ones clash with symbols already in the base.

- There are dozens of predefined named bases to specify as input or output.

- You can define your own arbitrary base and alphabet (the set of positional notation symbols), just by providing the alphabet.

	- E.g.: "`a 0 c X 🫪 だ`" is a perfectly valid, functional base-6 (for some reason).

- Encodes and decodes binary data to and from text, for every power-of-two base (2 through 256, plus 2048, 32768, and 65536) and the standard chunked codecs base45, Ascii85, Z85, and base91. Other bases have no byte-exact mapping, so binary mode reports which bases qualify (the RAW column of `--list`) and refuses the rest.

	- In other words, it can do what `basenc` can do, also in O(N) linear time, at roughly the same speed - plus bases `basenc` never heard of, like base-2048 and base-65536.

		- *Regular finite positional base conversion, however, necessarily works in O(N^2) quadratic time*.

	- Binary-to-text encoding and decoding is a separate concept - and code path - than positional base translation. Only the power-of-two bases and the defined codecs have a spec for carrying raw bytes; the rest are positional-only.

- Accepts data from the command line, and/or from `stdin` (e.g. piped data).

## Why convert a number to a large base

There are myriad useful technical reasons, that would otherwise require chaining together a series of standard tools. Or, that would require using a web-based tool in a way that can't be scripted.

- As a trivial example, let's say you want to manually generate "serial numbers" now and then for physical, real-world use. You need, say, at most minute-level precision to ensure uniqueness. But you need short, human-readable, unambiguous characters rather than a long date or number.

	You could use POSIX time (the number of seconds since 1970), divided by 60 for shorter minute-level precision, then convert that integer to Bitcoin's original base-58 "readable" scheme.

	As another example, "2026-01-01 @ 12:15 PM" could be represented as "1fLcL4" in standard base-64 RFC 4648 §5 `64u`, or "£±Яᛯ" in base-256 `256jc1`.

- The more obvious example is encoding binary data to text. Base 64 (`64r`, `64u`, `64jc1`) is the most efficient way to encode binary to UTF-8 text.

	- But even higher bases are available for niche cases - e.g. base-2048 `2048twitter`, specifically designed by qntm for Twitter; or base-65536 `65536qntm` for optimal UTF-32 binary-to-text encoding.

At larger non-standard bases that this project created (e.g. `base-256jc1`), careful effort was made to:

- Avoid ambiguous characters that look like existing 0-9 A-Z ASCII characters and symbols.

- Avoid characters that are too wide and render poorly on fixed-width terminals.

- Avoid reserved characters across multiple operating systems and web standards, so that output can be used in those contexts. (Except for predefined standard base definitions that specify such characters, e.g. regular base-64.)

- Keep the character selection consistent across bases.

### Also why the -v2?

As you've probably noticed, the command `convert-base-v2` has a version number on the end - this is, possibly as a non-answer, to distinguish it from v1.

As predicted as an eventual possibility in the v1 project (also on github), this v2 has a necessary minor break in output from v1, in one narrow edge case. And like v1, in the future there may be good reasons for the output to change again in some future v3.

- *For example, there are no "official standards" for large bases above 94 as of time of writing. But that could change. This program has dozens of large named base defitions, that could someday result in a "name collision" with some future official standard. Unlikely, but possible. So to avoid overwriting an old script on a running system that may rely on this program and its predictable, stable, fully deterministic output - a new suffix number will be given to future programs if the output changes, and the two can coexist. "-v2" is there to coexist with "-v1" (and "-v1b"), and also leaves room for the possibility of new name collisions in the future, e.g. with a "-v3"*.

## Speed

`convert-base-v2` is very fast.

Binary/text stream encoding/decoding is the most easily benchmarked (and relevant in terms of raw speed), so here are benchmarked throughput results against the standard tools - one table per format.

(You can see that `convert-base-v2` smokes the "competition" on decoding. On encoding, it's only fractionally slower - not magnitudes.)

**Base-64**

| Program | text -> binary | binary -> text |
| :-- | --: | --: |
| `convert-base-v2` | **744** | 755 |
| coreutils `base64` | 323 | 1,056 |
| coreutils `basenc` | 323 | 1,048 |
| openssl `base64` | 276 | **1,221** |

**Base-32**

| Program | text -> binary | binary -> text |
| :-- | --: | --: |
| `convert-base-v2` | **596** | 716 |
| coreutils `base32` | 400 | **855** |
| coreutils `basenc` | 376 | 851 |

**Hex**

| Program | text -> binary | binary -> text |
| :-- | --: | --: |
| `convert-base-v2` | **521** | **850** |
| `xxd` | 57 | 102 |

Numbers are MiB/s. Mean of 10 runs, one process each, all I/O in a tmpfs (RAM) so disk speed doesn't enter into it. Every program gets identical input: the same 256 MiB blob of random bytes to encode, and each format's own canonical text to decode. Each tool is single-threaded. Reproducible with `github/utility/bench-encoders.bash` (it auto-skips tools you don't have). Test bench: AMD Ryzen 9 3950X (16 cores / 32 threads, Zen 2), 128 GiB DDR4-3600.

FYI: Base-64 is statistically the most compact way to store binary data as UTF-8 text. (Which makes sense when you understand how UTF-8 encoding works.)
	- All modern OSes use UTF-8 by default.
	- But some APIs use UTF-16 internally (best is a Base 32768)
	- Other APIs use UTF-32 (best is a Base 65536).

For embedding binary data in Twitter/𝕏 posts, qntm's base-2048 is allegedly optimal.

## Complex third-party binary encode/decode algorithms

This program faithfully recreates four complex (or at least non-direct and non-trivial) binary-to-text encoding algorithms - that ordinarily require custom implementation in JS, Rust, and/or Python:

- [Base 2048](https://github.com/qntm/base2048) - [qntm](https://github.com/qntm/)'s original JS version. Allegedly the most dense possible radix specifically for encoding binary data in a Twitter/𝕏 post. Not an official standard, but "published".

- [Base 2048](https://github.com/LLFourn/rust-base2048) - [LLFourn](https://github.com/LLFourn/)'s version written in Rust. Not an official standard, but published.

- [Base 32768](https://github.com/qntm/base32768) by [qntm](https://github.com/qntm/). You normally have to run the JS just to get this base's alphabet. This radix is the most optimal binary-to-text encoding for UTF-16. Not an official standard, but "published".

- [Base 65536](https://github.com/qntm/base65536) by [qntm](https://github.com/qntm/), "Unicode's answer to Base64". (Most optimal radix for binary-to-text encoding for UTF-32. Not an official standard, but "published".)

Note: This program doesn't use any of their published open-source code - they were engineered "clean-room" style, directly from their specs. (Only because - well, Go isn't those other languages.)

## Example output

The table below shows one base-10 number, `2023090613425900000000000000001`, represented in every displayable base.

Note that some of the larger bases appear to have longer output - but that's only due to being rendered with proportional fonts, combined with double-width Unicode characters. Look at the "Chars" column to see the actual # of characters in the output.

## List of predefined bases and their positional notation symbols

Any number of any size can be converted to and from any of these bases. Most support negative numbers and decimals, if the intention makes sense.

You can define your own arbitrary base of any size >1. These are just all of the common, standard, and/or published ones - plus a number of [well-thought-through](how_to_design_a_numeric_base.md) custom bases (of debatable varying utility).

| Base  | Name [arg]           | Aliases                                               | Description                      | Specification | Symbol alphabet [or at least first and last 64 tokens]

## How to design a numeric base

[This document](how_to_design_a_numeric_base.md) (in this repo) describes how to design a good numeric base - either as a positional notation system, and/or as a binary-to-text codec. It's not as easy as you might think. (Hence all the whacky bases as "official standards".)
