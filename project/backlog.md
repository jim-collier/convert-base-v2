# Project backlog

This is a product backlog just for pre-v1.0.0 release. After that, bugs, features, and enhancements will be managed in Github Issues, and/or [todo.md](../todo.md)

#### Done - Bugs

#### Done - New features and enhancements

- ✅ Raw binary conversion now covers, besides the powers of two, the defined streaming binary-to-text codecs: base45, Ascii85, Z85, and base91, each implemented per its official spec. Any other non-2^N base has no byte-exact mapping and is refused in binary mode. `--list` shows which bases qualify (RAW column). (An earlier attempt to make every base work via whole-value base-x was reverted in favor of this, since a positional whole-value encoding isn't what a streaming codec means.)

- ✅ Screenshots retired. The README no longer shows them and the CICD stage is off by default; the generator is kept so they can be made again if wanted. Dropped the orphaned image files.

- ✅ Rigorous CICD testing. Raw round-trips now cover every base (not just powers of two) at lengths that force padding, with fixed base-x vectors pinning the leading-zero convention. Added a resource profile (peak memory and wall time) and a base-x timing guard, both skipped by `--quick`.

- ✅ Create a new base that covers all possible printable keyboard characters in a plain text document. (Including programming code, regular human writing, email addresses, newline, return, tab, etc.) Without worrying about higher unicode alternatives (e.g. curly-quotes, mdash, etc.) - those would have to go through some separate conversion preprocessing in order to work with this base. I believe this should also covers Rich-Text format (which I believe has no special characters), MD, HTML, XML, JSON, embedded base64, etc., as-is.

- ✅ Create a base64 that's all emojis
	- Only emojis noted/suggested by unicode to print graphically.
	- Symbols in LANG=C order.
	- Use generic yellow emojis for skintone-based ones, not skin-tone variants.
	- Skip emojis that look too similar; use only the first one.

- ✅ Improve the performance of streaming binary-to-text conversion and vice-versa, to better approach existing linux utilities. Go should be able to get close.

- ✅ An optional padding scheme for custom bases (not necessarily `===`). The published big bases and the RFC base32/base64 bases already pad correctly; this is about letting user-defined bases opt into padding too.

- ✅ Update comments in code, help output, readme.md, and design.md to properly use "radix" and/or "base" in context, etc. But not the actual program interface, don't change that.

- ✅ Base64 (RFC 4648 s4) and base32 (RFC 4648 s6) binary output is now padded with `=` to the standard group boundary, matching the RFC test vectors. The URL and hex variants stay unpadded, and decoding accepts input with or without padding.

- ✅ Binary conversions to the big published bases (both base 2048's, 32768, 65536) round-trip at any input length and match the reference encoders byte-for-byte, using each one's own secondary alphabet for the final partial chunk. Odd-length tails no longer come back a byte long. Fixed vectors from the reference implementations guard the interop.

- ✅ Bases with '-' in the symbol set now use '~' as the negative marker instead of the en-dash. '~' was free in all four affected bases (45, 64u, 64h, 69prsh).

- ✅ Help: clarified the text for the index-related flags (`--get-index-count`, `--get-base-name`, `--show-symbols`, `--by-index`).

- ✅ `--list`: the NAME is no longer repeated in the ALIASES column.
